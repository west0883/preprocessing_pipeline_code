% Modified from SCA_manual_masking.m, just the manual masking parts. Will
% also put in code from create_bloodvessel_masks_withbackgroundmasks.m . 
% Let's you keep adding masks until you say you're done. You can return to
% it. 

% This has the exact same code as manual_masking_loop, just changes the
% output directories.
