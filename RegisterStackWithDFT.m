% Runs registration within stacks and across stacks within the same day to
% a representative image of that day. Uses dftregistration function. 

function [registered_stack, all_tforms]=RegisterStackWithDFT(reference_image, stack_to_register, usfac)

    % Inputs: 
    % reference_image -- the representative image (of that recording day) that
    % you're registering all frames of all stacks to. MUST BE BLUE CHANNEL
    % stack_to_register -- the data matrix of a stack to register. 3D (pixels,
    % pixels, frames). MUST BE
    % BLUE CHANNEL
    % usfac -- "upsampling factor" for dftregistration function (for within stack & 
    % day registration); determines the sub-pixel resolution of the registration; 

    % Outputs:
    % registered_stack -- the stack with each frame registered; 3D (pixels,
    % pixels, frames)
    % all_tforms -- all the shifts that were applied; 3D (rows shifted, cols 
    % shifted, frames)

    % Run 2D Fourier transform on reference image  
    fRef=fft2(reference_image); 

    % Find number of frames of stack
    frames=size(stack_to_register,3); 
    
    % Initialize output matrices
    % The "all_tforms" will hold the diffphase, row shift, and column shift for each frame 
    all_tforms=NaN(3,frames); 
   
    % The registered stack will be the same size as the input stack
    registered_stack=NaN(size(stack_to_register)); 
  
    % Apply the 2D Fourier transform to the frame/image.

    % the current BLUE image with the fourier transform of the
