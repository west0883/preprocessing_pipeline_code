# preprocessing_pipeline_code

This code performs preprocessing of wide-field calcium imaging in mice, designed for use by the Ebner Lab at the University of Minnesota. These techniques are used in a [peer-reviewed scientific article](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhab373). 

This respository is a work in progress. For questions, problems, or concerns, please email Sarah West at [west0883@umn.edu](west0883@umn.edu).
